# Cell-Cell-Communication Analysis in the ZNP snATAC-seq PSP/CBD cohort


## Background

This repository adds on to snATAC-seq study in PSP/CBD brains [main branch](https://github.com/nes-b/snATAC-seq_psp_cbd).
Here we assess cell-cell-communication with [CellChat](https://github.com/sqjin/CellChat).
