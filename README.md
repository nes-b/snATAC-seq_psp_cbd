# Single-nucleus ATAC-sequencing in PSP and CBD brains


## Background

This repository contains scripts and metadata of our human brain tissue study: 

**Single Nucleus Accessible Chromatin Profiling Highlights Distinct Astrocyte Signatures in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and Corticobasal Degeneration**. 
*https://doi.org/10.1007/s00401-022-02483-8*


### Prerequisites

- Computing environment with >= 200 GB RAM and >= 12 CPU cores for the pre-processing (01_cellranger_snappre.Rmd) 
- Computing environment with >= 16 GB RAM (+ extra swap-memory) and >= 12 CPU cores for all other steps (recommended, Linux-based distro recommended)  
- RStudio Server or Rstudio Desktop running with R3.6 or R4.0 (for *pathfindR*)
- ImageJ for running image pre-processing macros

Please see https://www.r-project.org/ and https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/index.html

- Raw data (bam files) can be accessed via the [European Nucleotide Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB54978)

### Code Execution

The code can be run from within R and ImageJ/Macros.
