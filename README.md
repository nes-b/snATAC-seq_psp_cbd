# Single-nucleus ATAC-sequencing in PSP and CBD brains


## Background

This repository contains scripts and metadata of our human brain tissue study: 

**Single Nucleus Accessible Chromatin Profiling Highlights Distinct Astrocyte Signatures in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and Corticobasal Degeneration**. 


### Prerequisites

- Computing environment with >= 200 GB RAM and >= 12 CPU cores for the pre-processing (01_cellranger_snappre.Rmd) 
- Computing environment with >= 16 GB RAM (+ extra swap-memory) and >= 12 CPU cores for all other steps (recommended, Linux-based distro recommended)  
- RStudio Server or Rstudio Desktop running with R3.6 or R4.0 (for *pathfindR*)

Please see https://www.r-project.org/


### Code Execution

The code can be run from within R.
